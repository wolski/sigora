\title{sigora: Signature Overrepresentation Analysis}
\description{
Pathway Analysis is statistically linking observations on the molecular level to biological processes or pathways on the systems(i.e., organism, organ, tissue, cell) level. Traditionally, pathway analysis methods regard pathways as collections of single genes and treat all genes in a pathway as equally informative. However, this can lead to identifying spurious pathways as statistically significant since components are often shared amongst pathways. SIGORA seeks to avoid this pitfall by focusing on genes or gene pairs that are (as a combination) specific to a single pathway. In relying on such pathway gene-pair signatures (Pathway-GPS), SIGORA inherently uses the status of other genes in the experimental context to identify the most relevant pathways. The current version allows for pathway analysis of human and mouse datasets. In addition, it contains pre-computed Pathway-GPS data for pathways in the KEGG and Reactome pathway repositories and mechanisms for extracting GPS for user-supplied repositories.

\details{
Signature Overrepresentation Analysis

This package implements the pathway analysis method SIGORA. For an in depth
description of the method, please see our manuscript in PeerJ.  In short: a
\emph{GPS} (gene pair signature) is a (weighted) pair of genes that \emph{as
a combination} occurs only in a single pathway within a pathway repository.
A query list is a vector containing a gene list of interest (e.g. genes that
are differentially expressed in a particular condition).  A \emph{present}
GPS is a GPS for which both components are in the query list.  SIGORA
identifies relevant pathways based on the over-representation analysis of
their (present) GPS.

\section{Getting started}{


To install from CRAN:\cr \code{install.packages('sigora')}\cr As an
alternative, you can download the tarball and install from the local file:
\cr \code{install.packages("sigora_3.0.tar.gz",type="source",repos = NULL)}
\cr To load the library:\cr \code{library("sigora")}
}

\section{Motivation}{


A thought experiment Imagine you randomly selected
3 KEGG pathways, and then randomly selected a total of 50 genes from all
genes that that are associated with any of these pathways. Using traditional
methods (hypergeometric test using individual genes), how many pathways
would you estimate to show up as statistically overrepresented in this
"query list" of 50 genes?  Let us do this experiment!  Everything related to
human KEGG Pathways can be found in \code{kegH}.  A function to randomly
select n genes from m reandomly selected pathways is
\code{genesFromRandomPathways}.  The traditional Overrepresentation Analysis
(which is the basis for many popular tools) is available through \code{ora}.
Putting these together:\cr

\code{data(kegH)}\cr
\code{a1<-genesFromRandomPathways(seed=12345,kegH,3,50)}\cr ## originally
selected pathways:\cr \code{a1[["selectedPathways"]]}\cr ## what are the
genes \code{a1[["genes"]]}\cr ## Traditional ora identifies dozens of
statistically significant pathways!\cr \code{ora(a1[["genes"]],kegH)}\cr ##
Now let us try sigora with the same input:\cr \code{sigoraRes <-
sigora(GPSrepo =kegH, queryList = a1[["genes"]],level = 4)}\cr ## Again, the
three originally selected pathways were:\cr
\code{a1[["selectedPathways"]]}\cr

You might want to rerun the above few lines of code with different values
for \code{seed} and convince yourself that there indeed is a need for a new
way of pathway analysis.
}

\section{Available Pathway-GPS repositories in SIGORA}{


The current version of the package comes with precomputed GPS-repositories
for \emph{KEGG} human and mouse (kegH and kegM respectively), as well as for
\emph{Reactome} human and mouse (reaH and reaM respectively).  The package
provides a function for creating GPS-repositories from user's own
gene-function repository of choice (example \emph{Gene Ontology Biological
Processes}).  The following section describes this process of creating one's
own GPS-repositories using the \emph{PCI-NCI} pathways from National Cancer
Institute as an example.
}

\section{Creating a GPS repository}{


You can create your own GPS repositories using the \code{makeGPS()} function.
 There are no particular
requirements on the format of your source repository, except: it should be
provided either a tab delimited file or a dataframe with \bold{three columns
in the following order: \cr PathwayID, PathwayName, Gene.}\cr

\code{ data(nciTable)} \cr ## what does the input look like? \cr \code{
head(nciTable)} \cr ## create a SigObject. use the saveFile parameter for
future reuse. \cr \code{nciH<-makeGPS(pathwayTable=nciTable,
saveFile='nciH.rda')} \cr
\code{ils<-grep("^IL",idmap[,"Symbol"],value=TRUE)}\cr
\code{ilnci<-sigora(queryList=ils,GPSrepo=nciH,level=3)}\cr
}

\section{Analysing your data To preform Signature Overrepresentation}{


Analysis, use the function \code{sigora}.  For traditional
Overrepresentation Analysis, use the function \code{ora}.
}

\section{Exporting}{


Exporting the results Simply provide a file name to the
\code{saveFile} parameter of \code{sigora}, i.e. (for the above
experiment):\cr \code{sigRes<- sigora(kegH,queryList= a1$genes,level= 2,
saveFile="myResultsKEGG.csv")}\cr You will notice that the file also
contains the list of the relevant genes from the query list in each pathway.
The genes are listed as human readable gene symbols and sorted by their
contribution to the statistical significance of the pathway.
}

\section{Gene identifier mapping Mappings}{


between \emph{ENSEMBL}-IDS,\emph{ENTREZ}-IDS and Gene-Symbols are performed
automatically.

 You can, for instance, create a \emph{GPS}-repository using
\emph{ENSEMBL}-IDs and perform \emph{Signature Overrepresentation Analysis}
using this repository on a list of \emph{ENTREZ}-IDs.

\examples{

data('kegH'); data('idmap')
barplot(table(kegH$L1$degs),col="red",
main="distribution of number of functions per gene in KEGG human pathways.",
ylab="frequency",xlab="number of functions per gene")
## creating your own GPS repository
nciH<-makeGPS(pathwayTable=load_data('nciTable'))
ils<-grep("^IL",idmap[,"Symbol"],value=TRUE)
## signature overrepresentation analysis:
sigRes.ilnci<-sigora(queryList=ils,GPSrepo=nciH,level=3)
